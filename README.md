# AoC2021
My submissions for Advent of Code 2021. By going in chronological order, you can see me learn to code in real time!

I'm still learning how to code, you'll see me switch from C++ to C# early on. This is because I don't know what I'm doing.

I'm also learning how to use git (and github), and VS Code, but at least now I can document my experience, huh?
